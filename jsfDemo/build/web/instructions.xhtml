            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Deep within a maze of caverns and twisting tunnels lives a creature 
                known as the Wumpus. Protected by giant bats and pits of slime, the 
                Wumpus feeds on unwary visitors to its cavern.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are the daring hunter who tracks the Wumpus to its lair! Armed 
                with a single arrow, you explore the maze of caverns, searching for 
                clues to tell you where the Wumpus is hiding. Once you think you've 
                found the Wumpus, you fire your arrow into its cavern. But be careful!
                If you choose the wrong cavern, you will be the next victim of the 
                Wumpus.
            </p>
            <h1>Exploring The Maze</h1>
            <p>
                You explore the maze by moving the hunter through openings in the maze.
                You can move up, down, left, or right by pressing the appropriate 
                arrow key.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding to the excitement of the game is the computer's "wrap-around" 
                feature. If you move the hunter off the edge of the maze, it reappears 
                at the opposite side. The screen "wraps around" both horizontally and 
                vertically to connect all the caverns, helping you imagine 
                that you are in a three-dimensional maze.
            </p>

            <h1>Tracking Down The Wumpus</h1>
            <p>
                The Wumpus makes its lair in one of the caverns in the maze. You know 
                you're getting near the Wumpus when you enter a cavern with bloodspots
                (shown on the screen as a large red dot in the cavern). These dots 
                appear in all caverns within two caverns of the Wumpus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a hunting tip: If you are in a spotted cavern that is connected
                to a clear cavern (no red dot), you can explore one cavern further 
                before you risk entering the Wumpus' cavern. (That's because all 
                caverns within two caverns of the Wumpus have a red dot.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The trick to finding the Wumpus is to determine which cavern is more 
                than two caverns away from all unspotted caverns. That cavern is the 
                Wumpus' lair. NEVER enter the Wumpus' lair, or else you lose the game.
            </p>
            <h1>Caution! Slime Pit</h1>
            <p>
                When you enter a cavern that has green walls instead of blue walls, 
                you are approaching a slime pit. Slime pits are vast pools of stagnant 
                water that fill a cavern. If you enter a slime pit cavern, you fall in
                and lose the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Slime pits can usually be avoided, since all caverns within one cavern
                of a pit have green walls. But move carefully - there are two slime 
                pits in the maze, and sometimes they are right next to each other.
            </p>
            <h1>Do Not Disturb The Bats</h1>
            <p>
                Some of the caverns in the maze are inhabited by very large bats. The 
                first time you enter a cavern containing bats, a bat symbol appears in 
                the cavern. The bats know that you are there, but they ignore you for 
                now.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you later reenter a cavern with bats,they pick you up and carry you off to somewhere in the 
                maze..., a slime pit, the Wumpus' lair, or even the cavern where your 
                flight began. Then they choose a new place to live.
            </p>
            <p>
            The bats may set you in either a mapped or unmapped area of the maze. 
             But if the bats drop you in a slime pit or 
            the Wumpus' lair, the game is over.
            </p>
            <h1>Once The Wumpus Is Located</h1>
            <p>
                When you think you know where the Wumpus is, it's time to fire your 
                arrow. (You should be in a cavern that connects to the 
                Wumpus' lair.) Press Q to indicate that you are ready to fire. The 
                hunter figure draws its bow. Then press an arrow key to 
                direct the arrow into the tunnel that you think leads to the Wumpus. 
                The arrow follows the tunnel to the next cavern.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the cavern you fire into is the Wumpus' lair, you win! If you are 
                wrong, the Wumpus hears the arrow and comes looking for you. You only 
                have one arrow, so if you miss you lose the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: If you change your mind and decide not to shoot after you've 
                pressed Q, simply press Q again.
            </p>
            <h1>At The Hunt's End</h1>
            <p>
                The hunt is over when you fire your arrow, fall into a slime pit, or 
                enter the Wumpus' lair. If you win, press the button at the top of the screen to submit your 
                score (time and number of moves).
